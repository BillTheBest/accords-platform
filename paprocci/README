STARTING EVERYTHING 
******** **********
This example will guide you towards a quick running example of Accords (the CompatibleOne platform) using as a service provider the ProActive Parallel Suite. 

1. Run:

	$ ./test/pademo_place_files.sh

2. Make sure you have a running instance of ProActive Resource Manager and Scheduler (PACAGrid can be used to avoid this step).

3. Start up ACCORDS: 

	$ ./test/pademo_init.sh 

Now you can do co-parser and co-broker of any manifest.xml file you have in there.
