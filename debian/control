 The CompatibleOne Security Services component is a standalone OCCI REST server
 executable program and must have been started after the publisher and before all other
 components of the platform.
 The principles, on which the security of the platform depends, require the use of
 Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.0) to be announced and accepted by all server and client
 endpoints. The exchange of Certificates between communicating endpoints is strongly encouraged.
 Authentication of processes and users must be performed through an identity management
 system and will result in authorization being accorded for access to the platform and its components.

Description: CompatibleOne Accords Platform - All packages
 CompatibleOne is an open source project which provides a model, CORDS
 (CompatibleOne Resource Description Schema), and a platform,
 ACCORDS (Advanced Capabilities for CompatibleOne Resource Distribution Services),
 for the description and federation of different clouds comprising resources provisioned
 by heterogeneous cloud service providers. CompatibleOne's flexible service architecture
 makes it independent from any Cloud Service Provider (from OpenStack to OpenNebula,
 from Azure to Vcloud) and can address all types of cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS,
 XaaS, BpaaS, …) and any type of cloud service deployment (public, private, community and hybrid).
 The goals of CompatibleOne are to:
 - Provide entrepreneurs and organisations unimpeded access to cloud technologies
 - Provide innovative platform of services, that go beyond the standard services provided by existing cloud providers
 - Remove the constraints of vendor lock-in
 - Provide a platform that the community can evolve rapidly and adapt according to their needs
