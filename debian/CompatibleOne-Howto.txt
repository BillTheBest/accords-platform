# Howto use CompatibleOne.
# (C) 2012 Vincent Renardias <vincent@renardias.com>

This is just a quick blurb about how to use CompatibleOne. For the 
full and up to date instructions, please see http://www.compatibleone.org/

The CompatibleOne framework can be started from any directory containing the necessary
configuration and authorisation files.
To make things easier for people new to CompatibleOne a default working directory is
created in /var/lib/accords.
If you want to change this directory or not start CompatibleOne at boot-up, please edit
/etc/default/accords accordingly.

That's the directory used by the CompatibleOne instance started by the init files.

Some configuration files are static and must be modified by hand; some other files are 
automatically generated and will be updated when the 'accords-config' script is run.
The main log file 'co-log' is located in the same directory.

To reconfigure CompatibleOne to your needs/configuration, you need to:
- make sure the platform isn't currently running ('co-stop')
- edit accords.ini
- run accords-config
- check the list of files in the list below to see which ones you'd have to edit
  for your purpose
- start the platform ('co-start')
- you can now parse your manifest and agreement files ('co-parser') and then ask for the 
  provisioned machines to be deployed and run ('co-broker').

A dashboard is available on http://localhost/accords/ (if you installed the package
compatibleone-dashboard), the default login is 'admin', with 'admin' as password.


Here's a list of the files which should be present in your accords working directory along
with their role/use.

 * Certificates.crt :
	Base list of X.509 certificates to be used for inter-component communication
   when the CompatibleOne platform is running in secure mode.

 * accords.ini : 
	Main configuration file; all the settings in this file are commented and pretty much 
   self-explanatory.

 * accounts.xml : 
	Account credentials to be used at each Cloud Provider.

 * coips.xml : 
	Base machine types to be used by the CompatibleOne Image Production Service (coips).

 * cords_ec2config.xml : 
	Config file to be used for Amazon EC2 access.

 * cords_user.xml : 
	Default user/password file used for inter-compontent communication.

 * metrics.xml : 
	Configuration and shell commands to be used by COEES.

 * openssl.cnf :
	Configuration file used by accords-config to create the original certificates to
   work in secure mode; edit it to use your corporation name, etc...

 * os_config.xml, az_config.xml and on_config.xml :
	Respectively : Open Stack config file, Windows Azur config file, Open Nebula config file

 * rest : 
	This directory must be created before the launch of CompatibleOne and will receive the 
   log of all the requests.

 * service :
	This directory must be created empty before the launch of CompatibleOne.

 * style.css :
	The css style sheet used when a browser is pointed at the OCCI components. Several of
   them are available from /etc/accords if you don't like the default style.

 * ports.xml : 
	File autogenerated by accords-config, lists the TCP ports used by each CompatibleOne component.

 * accords.xml : 
	File autogenerated by accords-config.
